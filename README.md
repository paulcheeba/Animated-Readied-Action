# Animated-Ready-Action
A little automated readied action ring around a token for Foundry VTT.

I made this up for my group to use as a visual indicator they are holding a readied action. The feature uses the following modules: Sequencer (applying and removing the animation), DAE (to appy the status effect, execute the special expiries and call on the macro), MidiQOL (special expiries) and Times-up (duration expiries).
Included is an Ready-Action item json for the Ready Action feature, and an accompanying Ready-Action-VFX macro that gets called on, and my Ready status/macro/item icon (point the DAE, Macro and Item icon image browsers to the folder you import the icon to).

# Automation:
Use the feature directly from your character sheet to apply to your character's token. The status icon and animated webm are removed automatically at the start of your characters next turn and/or upon the character's use of an action.
